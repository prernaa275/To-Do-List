# To-Do-List
This little to-do list app is built entirely with HTML and feels simple, friendly, and easy to use. You can type in any task you want to remember, add it with a single click, and see it appear neatly in your list. Each task comes with a tiny remove button, so clearing things out is quick and effortless. The design is clean, the layout is straightforward, and everything works smoothly right inside your browser—no extra setup, no complicated steps, just a handy place to keep track of what you need to get done.
